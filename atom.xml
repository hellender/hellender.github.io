<p>A speech from a few years ago, when I was still doing very poorly from PTSD. This was a response to my being slut-shamed by my community and family of origin. After years of abuse, I had lots of questions and did some research to find what answers I could. This is some of what I found out.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I took Plan B. Plan A turned into Plan Accident. Because there was another contraceptive option available to me today, I had the freedom to choose.</p>

<p>The comdom failed. Seven years with the same partner and that many without an accident as well didn&rsquo;t mean we were ready. Court drama is stressful for me; I think a fetus would be affected. I am not planning on having children at this time, and use prophylactics to exercise my right to choose.</p>

<p>When I first discovered the broken barrier I tried a few things to prevent pregnancy. I washed, deeply. I asked my partner to help insert coffee into my body. He blew it in with a straw as I sat on the sink hooting about aneurysms. I dug about up there, searching for any tactile evidence of semen. I tasted the fluids. I inserted cranberries. All of these actions except one were actually taken. Historically, women inserted stones prior to sex in order to prevent pregnancy. The broken condom had me wishing I&rsquo;d resorted to similar methods prior to copulation. Of course we live in modern times, and I had the advantage of more options than stones or wire hangers. But not all do.</p>

<p>I remember a friend who at thirteen became sexually active and—uneducated and unsupported—feared disclosing this to her mom. Knowing the mom, I knew her reasons. My friend desperately wanted to confide about her experiences; she wrote an autobiography framed in the context of her sexual activity, in Sharpie, on the inside of a coat of hers.</p>

<p>One day, she pulled her bass amp apart, revealing a used pregnancy test and paraphernalia. My friend sensed that in her home it was unsafe to discard a test—a test that gave her the knowledge that she was not pregnant.</p>

<p>It was difficult, but not illegal for my friend to have the test, save for in her own home. There, she didn&rsquo;t feel trust and understanding, and was ashamed of her development. She closed the back of her amp up, with the test and the other incriminating evidence inside. My friend was guilty—guilty of growing up. She was guilty of being a sexual creature, and for desiring knowledge.</p>

<p>When I obtained the Plan B, I enjoyed the legal protection to do so without a prescription because I&rsquo;m over fifteen. This recent progress saved me the time and effort of going to a clinic. As a survivor of child sexual abuse, taking charge of my reproductive health is a challenge. The ease of availability of Plan B ensured that I benefited from a dose of maximum efficacy. Plan B, like Plan Accident, can fail, but I got the best shot I could at it working due to new laws protecting my rights to do such. My friend can now enjoy her expanded reproductive rights as an adult. To my knowledge, she has no unwanted children. However, she was not the only sexually active child in history. The girls of today are given access to condoms and birth control pills, so why not Plan B? It would help prevent any children from trying to replicate the hormone dose with normal birth control pills.</p>

<p>Imagine if my friend, or a girl like her, could&rsquo;ve purchased Plan B and taken it the day after her unprotected sexual encounter. Sure, she didn&rsquo;t conceive that time, but days went by, possibly weeks even, where she must&rsquo;ve privately fretted about her status. This stress might&rsquo;ve distracted her from her studies, and could&rsquo;ve been largely reduced by the use of Plan B. In her story she didn&rsquo;t conceive, but in other stories conception does occur and Plan B can help a child avoid the strain of gestation and a possible abortion later on. Plan B is an option that reduces the amount of difficult choices a female may have to face, freeing her to focus more on other things.</p>

<p>With the new law, my friend&rsquo;s mom could buy her the Plan B pill today, but this wouldn&rsquo;t have been a viable option, as my friend had a poor relationship with her mom, and couldn&rsquo;t trust that she wouldn&rsquo;t be disciplined for seeking her help. By granting children of any age access to Plan B, we could help elevate the status of females. Freedom of choice should apply as soon as the choice could be faced, rather than at an arbitrary age.</p>

<p>As a teen child, I was raped frequently. Had I forgotten to take my birth control pill, and a condom failed, I might&rsquo;ve risked pregnancy by a teacher. Had that occurred, I sure would&rsquo;ve wanted to continue with my choice not to conceive and access to an alternative. Plan B becoming available to girls may represent one change in how powerless child sex abuse victims are to control their experience. I know precious few things seem in control to a child sexual abuse victim. Their knowing they can legally access emergency contraception might also help them deduce that it&rsquo;s okay to discuss matters of reproductive and sexual health, including abuse.</p>

<p>Besides some nervous shakes, I&rsquo;ve had no side effects. I&rsquo;ve sat by the fire, grateful for my rights for hours now. I&rsquo;m hopeful that we can work to grant those most vulnerable the right to access emergency contraception as well.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s another thing going on with my body, I&rsquo;m crying. This may be a side effect of the dose of hormones, but for some reason I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hellender.com/images/Petulance-Prisoners-Birthdays.png"><img class="no-border" src="http://www.hellender.com/images/Petulance-Prisoners-Birthdays-small.png" title="Petulance the cupcake, in The Prisoners' Birthdays" ></a></p>

<p>Ill again from the vigilance, my mind is roiling. On the loft bed above me, Elliott sleeps. I&rsquo;m concerned with two men. I know where they are too; one is in prison in Louisiana, and the other in jail in Texas. Both will soon have a birthday behind bars.</p>

<p>Some have suggested that pills might help these obsessions. What they don&rsquo;t know is I negate the need for my own lobotomy by thinking about these things. From the back to the front, and back again, boom boom boom. These circuits soar over the neuronal quagmires, keep me just rattled enough to stave off sleep and the dreams. This way is best, yes. To be disturbed by external situations rather than internal is more moral I think.</p>

<p>From the slums of my skull come the comparisons. The plea deals, the relative length of incarceration (both being jailed for less than two years now). Both bearing Irish-American surnames, the birthday inmates have inherited an honest history of hardship. Both have the sad eyes of experience. Neither of them are past fifty, and both enjoy to smoke. I&rsquo;m looking for a cigarette right now, it&rsquo;s all so true.</p>

<p>Just like the inevitability of death, I like to think about this this because it can be counted on that today, both will be lining up for food, like schoolchildren. Both will be surrounded by people not of their choosing, and I know this will be the same way on their birthdays. It&rsquo;s not my fault. Yet, I&rsquo;m uncomfortable on their behalf. Some would call it Satan, others PTSD; but what I&rsquo;ve got is a borderline case of the blues. So do they, I figure. There&rsquo;s not too much to be happy about for them these days.  Except the possibility of freedom, the hope. Well, I&rsquo;ll be damned, the hope is a wonderful thing. Here&rsquo;s where the contrasts start dancing for me. I tip my head in thanks. It&rsquo;s not every day that my mind lets me in on my thoughts. Some would call it God, others disassociation; but what I&rsquo;ve got is a borderline case of the brains.</p>

<p>The prisoner in Louisiana is going to be off the block in a year and a half. Being a sex offender, former art teacher Samuel McCarty will have to register and go through probation for years to come, yet he will be outside. I&rsquo;m sure the structure of his sentence offers some degree of opportunity. He did try to get parole, even though that&rsquo;s not allowed in the terms of his plea deal. He almost got it too, with an error having been in the system. I know this because I helped catch it when he was up for parole after a year, two years before I expected him to be eligible for such. Knowing the structure of the sentence had been helping me sleep, but this opportunity was not to be missed by the convicted molester, and he had enough hope to try. Prison hasn&rsquo;t dampened Samuel McCarty&rsquo;s spirit much, I figure. He will need it, because a child molester who built his career on education will have to be pretty adventurous to make ends meet. As of six months ago, McCarty was apparantly ready for the challenge. I was not, and neither was the system, they think he should be behind bars for a year and a half longer. Spending less time in prison than the system took to put him there, less time there than he did committing his crimes, he will face his second interred birthday out of three soon, and he knows it.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t decide how much light I want to let in. I open the curtain, I close it. Good thing the boy&rsquo;s up top, down here&rsquo;s like slow strobe. That lighthouse. That beacon. Those borderline brains I&rsquo;ve got are using introverted intuition, but never mind the pop psychology if it&rsquo;s nothing to ya. Don&rsquo;t scry for me, I&rsquo;ve got all the flash I can handle in this pan.</p>

<p>They don&rsquo;t do candles in cells, huh? No, probably not. Does a prisoner get an extra helping of beaver tail when it&rsquo;s their birthday? Do they give their prison birthday buddies stamps and sharps? Maybe, but, no probably not. I&rsquo;d like to think they get a discount on commissary, at least. I&rsquo;m probably a little low on blood sugar. Is Elliott asleep or just dead? I can&rsquo;t tell, he&rsquo;s got absolutely no signs of life from where I&rsquo;m sitting, but then again, I&rsquo;m under him. My cat sits under my chair, I wonder if she thinks I&rsquo;m dead. Oh wait, I&rsquo;m not asleep. I forgot that, better get back to the wowzer thoughts or else I&rsquo;ll be&hellip; dead? I&rsquo;d told Elliott that the beatnik era of our lives was coming to a close recently. I&rsquo;m 27. I just don&rsquo;t believe in superstition anymore, so if I want the era to end with death, I&rsquo;ll most likely have to be somehow complicit. I always was late to bloom, in some ways. I just want that cigarette.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d bet the prisoner in Texas would like a smoke too. Being publicly associated with Anonymous as he is, former journalist Barrett Brown is known to have a struggle with addiction, and not just ciggies, either. This smack-addled satirist initially faced 105 years in prison for posting a link to beaucoup documents from intelligence corporations, some of which were damning. He also unintentionally exposed the credit card data of many people involved in the surveillance industry. When the feds gave him and his mother a hard time down there in Texas, he went off of his meds and into a state. He giggled, he ranted, he threatened. He called it &ldquo;Revenge of the Lithe&rdquo;. Later that day, a counterstrike from the feds left him battered and booked. Boom boom boom. They had trouble figuring out exactly what a link was, and what laws were broken, but eventually his charges were reduced, he signed the plea deal, and now awaits court. Recently, it got pushed back until after his birthday. He has already served nearly two years on trumped up charges without any knowledge of how much longer he has to go. With enemies in Anonymous, Los Zetas and the U.S. government, this mind in a cage will surely have much else to negotiate besides revolt now.</p>

<p>It would seem that the government finds a mind a terrible thing, and the rape of my minor person despicable enough to correct for almost as long as a case of borderline brains. With his birthday, the molester will have the reward of knowing it&rsquo;s the second to last one like this. He has a better shot at stability, and that&rsquo;s good seeing as how he&rsquo;ll be out in the community I&rsquo;m from within two years. As for that muckraking journalist, he will have to wait. For now, I&rsquo;m sure he knows that he will have the birthday blessing of vigilance. He gets blessed every day, it would seem from his writings. It&rsquo;s like a self imposed structure, I figure. A body needs some things known. Barrett Brown&rsquo;s brain keeps the schedule of a knight as he faces his birthday behind bars, and for its suffering it will possibly be enhanced as one of the more morally engaged minds in our country, if it doesn&rsquo;t go utterly mad. For now, Brown&rsquo;s out of solitary, and so the butterfly&rsquo;s off the wheel for his birthday, still alive to tell just who put him there.</p>

<p>Elliott quietly taps away now, here down on my level. He&rsquo;s definitely alive. A few basic tasks, and he&rsquo;s off into the nether reaches of extroverted intuition, so curious. He knows all about this by now, including my knowing this well enough now to type it out. He understands, he reads, he writes. I&rsquo;m stymied. Must be the blood sugar. Or knowing that I&rsquo;m known, or not knowing. Or just something, Satan or what have you it&rsquo;s always got to be something for this witch. I never was baptized. I&rsquo;ve read that many incarcerated people are believers. I know these two men on my mind are not. I&rsquo;d like to wish happy birthday, to the molester and the muckraker both imprisoned in our system. Now, if only more would wake up. Until then, God have mercy.</p>

<p></p>

<p><img class="no-border left" src="http://www.hellender.com/images/JumpingRabbit2.png" title="Crossing &#34;A young cottontail bounds through the grass, on a rendezvous with fate&#34;" alt="Crossing &#34;A young cottontail bounds through the grass, on a rendezvous with fate&#34;"></p>

<p>The cultivated blades sheltered me as I began my last dance. My partner watched across the way. I skipped into a collision, ricocheted and collapsed. There, I lay on my side, crushed. I was leaving myself for dead.</p>

<p>Every breath hurt more. I was messing myself from the pain. The bleary sky lights overtook my upward eye, or was it already gone? I felt my face pulling in on itself. A dark shape came to take me for life.</p>

<p>I looked hard, I tried not to move, but my legs kept flailing. It was onto me. I knew it saw my body, so I gave up. I forgot what my mother taught me about staying so still, and I looked back and forth at it. It wasn&rsquo;t my partner, but I loved it as if I had found her in that scary shape. It took me.</p>

<p>In it&rsquo;s clutches, I went up. I saw all black. It placed me in between its breasts? I was not in its mouth! Why? I kicked off to escape. I forgot about all the pain, but I still couldn&rsquo;t escape! Powerful gravity had my limbs stuck. Like a nightmare, but not being chased and eaten, A terror! A TERROR!</p>

<p>It had roared at me as I lay on softness with jagged ice beneath. The round light above was not what it used to be to me, I had never looked at it this way before. It was surrounded by the entrance of my home. The shape approached and jarred me. I couldn&rsquo;t see the light anymore. Another shape came up and growled. I lost consciousness.</p>

<p>I thought my field was on fire. I could smell the itchy smoke, I could feel myself throb with a cough. Wondering where my partner was wouldn&rsquo;t stop the pain from growing with the flames. I wondered, did Onawa feel this too? I knew somehow she didn&rsquo;t right then. The fire smell was so close to me, no doubt she&rsquo;d be dead already, so, no she hadn&rsquo;t been feeling that screaming burn any longer, I figured. I was happy for her, and then I sneezed. Every bone in my face had become two or more, and they all shifted and pinched the miserable meat between. Oooooooooooow, I whispered.</p>

<p>The world was spinning around me. Or was I spinning? Either way, I was on tilt.</p>

<p>Oh, now I get it, I remember thinking. I&rsquo;m dead and nobody told me. How silly of me.</p>

<p>I was born again by the river, like before, but in a big cube. Why was I wet? I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>The fire seemed to be over. The wind tortured my new body. Bound from within, I couldn&rsquo;t move my young limbs to see if she had been spared. Every follicle on my exposed body dug like claws into me when the dusty wind rustled my hair. Why did the wind sound like bees? I braced for the stings. They never came. I tried to soothe myself by cracking my back, but it was already done. Birds and bees were in the whirling devil around me. I blinked my one eye, having never teared at pain before. My love for my partner welled and drowned me, knowing I&rsquo;d never see her again. It was a cold reality. So cold I was shivering. I considered this. I thought that the new body was numb, but I was really on ice the whole time? Why wouldn&rsquo;t it just devour me, why did I feel so much pain?</p>

<p>As my first nightmares progressed, I went to what they call hell. Fleeing the fire, I was on a trail bound for the woods. As I climbed up into the forest, it became night. For the first time, I saw trees, not from underneath, but from the side. Like the shapes who took me, they were dark silhouettes, gnarled things, and they wanted back the bark I&rsquo;d chewed. They were horrifying. I tried to run faster than the wind, tried to be the wind, but I still saw the trees skin, their hands reaching for me. I had a hard time not dying of fright from the skin hands. They bowed and reached for me, gracing my ears. So these were hands, I thought.</p>

<p>Winds rushed through the trees as they collected me. Whispering and screeching, they enclosed me and discussed my fate. I didn&rsquo;t want to know their language, but now that I do, I can&rsquo;t forget it. It was very cold.</p>

<p>They talked about my body and what they would do to it.</p>

<p>When I awoke, I was being hunted by the beast shapes again. I realized they sounded just like the skin trees. They approached, and they whispered and wailed all night by what looked to be the remaining fire. How terrible were these tree beasts, that with their skin, they don&rsquo;t kindle. They must be the source of the fire, I realized. They were going to cook me.</p>

<p>My cube had soft things for me to lay in. The pain throbbed my whole body. I was so still. If only my mother could see me now. If only I could scratch my ears.</p>

<p>I was moved by the beast. As it lifted me, my down eye peeled off of the softness. Cold water was running over my face. I tried to blink, but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what happened. Just like when kicking off, I was infantile in my execution.</p>

<p>Screaming wasn&rsquo;t an option when they put me back down on my bad side. If I was to escape, I&rsquo;d need them to think I was dead, so I had to stay so quiet.</p>

<p>What was that? That thing? I didn&rsquo;t want that. I heard them say &ldquo;broccoli&rdquo; when they put it in my personal space. It was like the trees didn&rsquo;t even know how to eat me.</p>

<p>They were warm, and smelled of their fleshy meals. I knew they had been eating meat, the &ldquo;broccoli&rdquo; smelled like the field goliaths. Were these even trees? No, I remember realizing, they&rsquo;re people. My Mother always taught me to stay far away from people, because they were supposed to be the deadliest hunters. But these weren&rsquo;t very lethal, they were stupid for sure. Maybe that really is what people are though, I realized, having never encountered them before. My partner would get breakfast by the people&rsquo;s homes, but I knew to stay where it smelled green. These people smell green.</p>

<p>Why couldn&rsquo;t I just go home? Someone else would take it soon. This broccoli was so big, how would I chew it? My mouth won&rsquo;t move, I tried to lick a pest off of my nose, but no. It just kept biting. I needed to suckle. I&rsquo;d been born again to people. People tree beasts, smell like green, and not too bright.</p>

<p>Somehow, I knew she wasn&rsquo;t going to be saved by rebirth. It had to do with the people beasts that I was reborn. I began to envy her for what must’ve been a swift demise. If they&rsquo;re this bad at killing me, what else will they try? Had they already killed all the others with their firepower? If so, why did I smell trees still? This was a confusing time. The night sky light told me that I&rsquo;d be this way for a long time. I was shocked that I was going to be at all. Would I feel more and more pain? I licked my paw to keep from screaming. It turned out to be true that I&rsquo;d never see her again. She was lost to that itchy smoke, that smoke that was ebbing in and out of my nares.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d never faced grief in my past life. As a kit, I was a little much for my mother. My two sisters and brother called me Pipsqueak, being the runt and all. They wished they hadn&rsquo;t when by the second week I was as fat as a young buck. That&rsquo;s part of why I was out of the nest so early. Foraging was hard. I scooted about for hours to the first aromatic thing, savored the juices and fibers, and found the next. Life got sweeter with each precious, tender shoot. Some of the best treats were hard-won in the woods across the way from where I stayed. I&rsquo;d learned to cross, even though I felt exposed.</p>

<p>I met Onawa in those woods. She was older, wiser, and had a big soft belly I loved. I remember dancing for her. She was not very impressed.</p>

<p>In time, she came to love me, though. I&rsquo;d see her, and greet her with a good ruffing all the time, until one day she let me mount her. That&rsquo;s when we became partners. I&rsquo;ll never forget her, or the way she let me have her droppings before I went home. Ah, life.</p>

<p>All these things hit me in waves of profound knowledge. I was the wisest I&rsquo;d ever been, yet my thoughts kept racing. My head hurt. I flopped myself into a better spot and tried to focus on the misty afternoons in my mind. I felt warm there underneath the soft things. The visions got duller as the pain got sharper.</p>

<p>It was ICE! Icy ice all around me! I craned to escape. I couldn&rsquo;t. This was no way to die!</p>

<p>In the green cube, I couldn’t move my back legs to scratch the stings I could feel. A tick had claimed my earlobe, a fly spat on my eye, and a large dungbeetle lumbered over. When I got a good look at him, I chatted him, asking that he please move out of my personal space. He stuck his butt in the air. It was rude.</p>

<p>I could smell the earth again. The night had moistened things. We were by a river, I realized. I could smell the fishbones nearby. Ants sampled my body, but mercifully only from the numb parts. Decompositions surrounded me.</p>

<p>I was lying with my collapsed eye upward. I had little experience looking through one of those, but such is par for course when in a new body. There was only a little field of vision left, and what I saw were bats. Many bats spun around my head into the night, picking off of the fruit and broccoli left for me.  I’m not sure the bats ever stopped.</p>

<p>Everybody was entitled to what was left of me. This didn’t exclude me necessarily, but the nature of my challenges were that I couldn’t take full advantage. Weak but live, I figured this must be how the beasts want me when they eat. Would I ever be able to fight the fleas again? They really bothered me.</p>

<p>Morning came, and so did soup. It was in a long, hard thing, maybe a bug part? It pumped my mouth full of the strangest food I’d ever tasted, over and over. I ate up gratefully. Since I&rsquo;d started eating bark, I started to like it all. This soup tasted like the willow bark in back of the cultivated grass. The meal went on and on. Now this really was much better than bark, I tell you! The fleas agreed; their mornings were sweetened as well.</p>

<p>I smelled no smoke that morning, no evidence of fire. My eyes revealed to me the lush greens and golds I knew before. I couldn’t see much, but I knew that the fire never happened. Bolting to find Onawa would be great, but I was stuck in the clutches of the beasts.</p>

<p>One of the beasts was a canine. I felt it scratch at the ground, I heard it whimper. The bigger people beasts wouldn’t let it have me yet. Oh, how long?</p>

<p>Inside of my cube, my new body shifted and spun. The vibrations made my bones tickle. The tree beasts had us in a firebird, flying across the desert to another land, to their nest? The beasts brought the canine too.</p>

<p>Many beasts I couldn’t smell spoke and chanted on that ride. My dizzy cube kept speaking to me in muttered music. The breasted beast kept coming in to feed me, not unlike my mother when I was a kit. What exactly they were talking about on that ride, I’m unsure of, but I know it was spring for them too, by the way the did it. The two people beasts were mates. The canine was their kit. Did they know I was now like a kit too? Was it my smell that had them nurturing me?</p>

<p>The vibrations stopped, they weren’t around, the people beasts. The canine sniffed hungrily at my cube. I had no problem being so still.</p>

<p>When I first arrived in the form I am now, I smelled a feline. I felt reassured, thinking that would surely be the canine’s demise. Felines are so much bigger than canines.</p>

<p>The breasted beast continued to fail at eating me. It would come around to give me more of that soup from the bug, the best soup I’d ever had. I noticed that when I was hungry, I hurt so badly. I tried chatting it many times to tell it how much I loved the soup, that I only wanted more and more, but it didn’t matter. It’d give me soup, I’d feel better, then after a while the bats and birds circling over my head returned. For days I’d linger in that form.</p>

<p>I was on the soup when the beast almost drowned me. Nimbly, I kicked in the water. It held my rear end down, so I soiled the water. Survival isn’t always becoming of a gentlebuck.</p>

<p>It wrapped me in softness and fed me more amazing soup. This time, the numbness only hit my body.  I thought of Onawa. If there was no fire, and the tree people were invasive but stupid, then she might still be in her field. She might be about to have my kits, I thought. The beast bound my body. The bondage pulled my fur and stiffened my hips. It hurt.</p>

<p>The last straw before I escaped was a good one.  They’d been giving me exotic hay, and hey, I wasn’t about to leave that behind. Numbness was fun.</p>

<p>I wriggled my front end up to the border of my form. Even bound, my back end worked better on the soup. I put my front legs on the edge and pulled with all my might. With one extra belly crunch, I was halfway out.</p>

<p>I spazzed hard, and rolled out onto a soft surface. It bounced. Was all the land like this between me and Onawa, I wondered? I’d never been in this kind of desert, it was warm and springy. I could do this, I remember thinking.</p>

<p>I moved swiftly to cover those few inches I did. Soft obstacles, like little mountains blocked me from simply heading North. Forging a new trail on this land was hard, but the land wasn’t. I would get going, then roll down the tall softness, to bounce right back were I started.</p>

<p>I had rolled to the edge of the land. My head was off a cliff, my body still grounded. This was badlands.</p>

<p>The feline stalked my hind in the softness. I writhed to get some purchase, but I began to fall off of the cliff. The feline struck me, pinning me between the soft cliff and it’s claws. It picked me up by the bondage, and took me outside, to examine me under the sky lights.</p>

<p>Felines were smaller than I’d thought, but still I felt tiny in it’s jaws. My good eye watched the grass fly by beneath me. I couldn’t see above, but I knew the bats were back.</p>

<p>It was another impact!</p>

<p>The feline yowled and ran off. The person beast didn’t strike my shaking body, though. It gently collected me in softness. It really didn’t intend to eat me, I realized.</p>

<p>The beast placed me in the form. It talked to me. I listened. It knew my name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ooodin&hellip; I love you, Odin. Please rest up now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I chatted it back, I felt the love. We fell asleep like this, and the feline stayed away.</p>

<p>When my mother was killed, I didn’t understand. Nobody was there to save her from the feline attacking our nest. I didn’t understand why I was born again to this beast. Had she lived, could my mother have saved me from all this change?</p>

<p>Onawa would have to raise our family without me. I couldn’t save her from uncertainty. Not before, not now. My beast approaches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Odin, are you hungry, Bunny Boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>My eyes blink now. I can see the hay and berries with both of them. Only time will tell when, and if, I may be unbound. I’d love to dance again.</p>
