{% img no-border /images/Roady_and_Grace.jpg "Roady N Grace" %}

Mixed Media, 2014. Inspired by Kimberly Holmes and her dedication to Roady, a former stray found sick and skinny on a Louisiana highway. Roady was given a second chance, and being Grace's dog was one of the possibilities he had after medical treatment.
