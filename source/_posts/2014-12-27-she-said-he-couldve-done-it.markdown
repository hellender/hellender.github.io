Her blue eyes shined in woe as she told me more. This was the first time Barrett Brown's grandmother had seen him in more than two years. She touched my hand and explained how he'd been voicing his concerns about the Feds over breakfast. Nobody imagined this was coming.

Not that it seemed to matter much to her, but every hair was in place, her dark clothing immaculate. Behind the decades, a bright soul was present, perhaps to better understand her descendant's past and the world's future. I saw her right hand shake terribly. On her left hand, a beautiful display of elongated diamonds sparkled like tears. This treasure was no doubt given to her by Barrett Brown's grandfather.

Hours melted by in hypocritical attempts to discredit political actions. Sitting by herself the whole damn day, her petite mouth grimaced. The words of the prosecutor seemed to hit the willowy lady like gut punches, over and over. It was a pain to see the likes of her sway in the storm surrounding Barrett Brown.

Members of the family look alike—whether or not they think alike has yet to be seen—but of my experience, I can say this: They know Barrett Brown is suffering. They know his health has been given next to no consideration. His grandmother reminded me of the possibility of suicide. She said he could've done it, but he didn't.
