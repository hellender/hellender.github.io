I took Plan B. Plan A turned into Plan Accident. Because there was another contraceptive option available to me today, I had the freedom to choose.

The comdom failed. Seven years with the same partner and that many without an accident as well didn't mean we were ready. Court drama is stressful for me; I think a fetus would be affected. I am not planning on having children at this time, and use prophylactics to exercise my right to choose.

When I first discovered the broken barrier I tried a few things to prevent pregnancy. I washed, deeply. I asked my partner to help insert coffee into my body. He blew it in with a straw as I sat on the sink hooting about aneurysms. I dug about up there, searching for any tactile evidence of semen. I tasted the fluids. I inserted cranberries. All of these actions except one were actually taken. Historically, women inserted stones prior to sex in order to prevent pregnancy. The broken condom had me wishing I'd resorted to similar methods prior to copulation. Of course we live in modern times, and I had the advantage of more options than stones or wire hangers. But not all do.

I remember a friend who at thirteen became sexually active and—uneducated and unsupported—feared disclosing this to her mom. Knowing the mom, I knew her reasons. My friend desperately wanted to confide about her experiences; she wrote an autobiography framed in the context of her sexual activity, in Sharpie, on the inside of a coat of hers.

One day, she pulled her bass amp apart, revealing a used pregnancy test and paraphernalia. My friend sensed that in her home it was unsafe to discard a test—a test that gave her the knowledge that she was not pregnant.

It was difficult, but not illegal for my friend to have the test, save for in her own home. There, she didn't feel trust and understanding, and was ashamed of her development. She closed the back of her amp up, with the test and the other incriminating evidence inside. My friend was guilty—guilty of growing up. She was guilty of being a sexual creature, and for desiring knowledge.

When I obtained the Plan B, I enjoyed the legal protection to do so without a prescription because I'm over fifteen. This recent progress saved me the time and effort of going to a clinic. As a survivor of child sexual abuse, taking charge of my reproductive health is a challenge. The ease of availability of Plan B ensured that I benefited from a dose of maximum efficacy. Plan B, like Plan Accident, can fail, but I got the best shot I could at it working due to new laws protecting my rights to do such. My friend can now enjoy her expanded reproductive rights as an adult. To my knowledge, she has no unwanted children. However, she was not the only sexually active child in history. The girls of today are given access to condoms and birth control pills, so why not Plan B? It would help prevent any children from trying to replicate the hormone dose with normal birth control pills.

Imagine if my friend, or a girl like her, could've purchased Plan B and taken it the day after her unprotected sexual encounter. Sure, she didn't conceive that time, but days went by, possibly weeks even, where she must've privately fretted about her status. This stress might've distracted her from her studies, and could've been largely reduced by the use of Plan B. In her story she didn't conceive, but in other stories conception does occur and Plan B can help a child avoid the strain of gestation and a possible abortion later on. Plan B is an option that reduces the amount of difficult choices a female may have to face, freeing her to focus more on other things.

With the new law, my friend's mom could buy her the Plan B pill today, but this wouldn't have been a viable option, as my friend had a poor relationship with her mom, and couldn't trust that she wouldn't be disciplined for seeking her help. By granting children of any age access to Plan B, we could help elevate the status of females. Freedom of choice should apply as soon as the choice could be faced, rather than at an arbitrary age.

As a teen child, I was raped frequently. Had I forgotten to take my birth control pill, and a condom failed, I might've risked pregnancy by a teacher. Had that occurred, I sure would've wanted to continue with my choice not to conceive and access to an alternative. Plan B becoming available to girls may represent one change in how powerless child sex abuse victims are to control their experience. I know precious few things seem in control to a child sexual abuse victim. Their knowing they can legally access emergency contraception might also help them deduce that it's okay to discuss matters of reproductive and sexual health, including abuse.

Besides some nervous shakes, I've had no side effects. I've sat by the fire, grateful for my rights for hours now. I'm hopeful that we can work to grant those most vulnerable the right to access emergency contraception as well.

There's another thing going on with my body, I'm crying. This may be a side effect of the dose of hormones, but for some reason I don't think so.
