I took Plan B. Plan A turned into Plan Accident. Because there was another contraceptive option available to me today, I had the freedom to choose.

The comdom failed. Seven years with the same partner and that many without an accident as well didn't mean we were ready. Court drama is stressful for me; I think a fetus would be affected.
