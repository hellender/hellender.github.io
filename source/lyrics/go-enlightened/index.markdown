Barrett Brown  
He don't fight with the fist,  
he fights with the pen,  
Cowboy Journalist,  
fending off hell  
from the gov  
workin' from above  
for Barrett Brown  
they have no love.  
The guy glows,  
and if you don't know  
this fight can't put out  
the brightness he's shined.  
Now fess up,  
raise a cup to  
Barrett Brown  

There go young gumshoe  
Go to isolation  
He got two blue eyeballs  
He one heretic Dick  
He got there frownin'  
on his knees  
Got to be a smoker  
you can still hear him wheeze  

He wear a clown face  
Has no room in his cell-space  
He got trigger-finger  
He shoot broken systems  
He say, "They watch you,  
they watch me;   
One thing I can tell you is that  
I'm not hiding  
Go enlightened, right now  
do it for me?"  

He dig those secrets  
He work as a journalist  
He got double-crossed  
He was ribcage cracker  
He got feet chained below his knees  
Hopin' for the best but don't need your G.O.D.s  
Go enlightened, right now  
the cost is free  

Right

[Audio of Barrett Brown from film]

He major-boaster  
He got advance book deal  
He got grandmother's daughter  
He one brain off-kilter
He say you don't need your G.O.D.  
Got to read his book again  
he's chargin' a fee  
Go enlightened, right now  
Oh can't you see?  

Go enlightened
