</div>
<p>Convoluted ethical reasoning has buttressed the Espionage Act for nearly a century. In 1919, Charles Schenck, General Secretary on the Executive Committee of the Socialist Party in Pennsylvania, was convicted along with Elizabeth Baer for violating the Espionage Act of 1917, although the intelligence he gathered and distributed along with Bear was open source. During WWI, Schenck had distributed more than 15,000 leaflets to men urging them to avoid the draft, citing the Thirteenth Amendment’s prohibition of involuntary servitude as a rationale. Schenck and Baer appealed their convictions, arguing that the Espionage Act of 1917 would negatively impact free discussion of the war, a right protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. When the Espionage Act was put into question by the Schenck and Baer appeals, the Court ruled that the Espionage Act was constitutional. Today the original Espionage Act of 1917 has been amended several times. Some have called for a repeal. I suggest that we consider how the Espionage Act has come into play in current times to weigh its value for the U.S. moving forward.</p>
<p>Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed details of secret surveillance and security vulnerabilities permitted by the U.S. government. Many are aware that he has been granted political asylum in Russia and won’t return to the U.S. for now. He is reported to have claimed that he wouldn't get a fair trial if he did. This statement is supported by the fact that the Espionage Act prohibits the release of confidential state information, and allows for no ethical arguments. Even though Snowden divulged that the American public and foreign entities who traffic into U.S. territory were being illegally spied on, he legally has no defense under the Espionage Act.</p>
<p>Snowden was exposed to secrets as part of his contract, and responded with dissenting action based on moral logic. He didn’t seek out secrets, they were part of his work environment, and yet because he knew them and leaked so much information, he is officially non grata to the U.S. President Obama has echoed this sentiment in his appraisal of Snowden’s actions:</p>
<blockquote>
“I will say that our nation's defense depends in part on the fidelity of those entrusted with our nation's secrets. (...) Moreover, the sensational way in which these disclosures have come out has often shed more heat than light, while revealing methods to our adversaries that could impact our operations in ways that we may not fully understand for years to come.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>Is it possible that these operations had not been fully understood by those undertaking them for years? The government has been enabled by the Espionage Act and the limited rights of whistleblowers. Now the U.S. President warns that due to leaks of true information, the NSA might fail to grasp how to properly respond to these revelations for years to come. This harkens back to the Schenck case, wherein his moral argument, based on the First Amendment, was invalidated by Judge Oliver Wendell Holmes, who declared:</p>
<blockquote>
“The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic. (...)The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent.”</blockquote>
<p>Shooting the messenger is a well known tactic for those looking to avoid the propagation of truth. This metaphor can be extended and applied to the well-known real life case of Chelsea Manning. After leaking an unparalleled amount of information, she was tried under the Espionage Act and dishonorably discharged from military duties. She had discovered information such as the as the Iraqi and Afghan War Logs, along with many other documents, and was intent on sharing them. Among the offences she was charged with was a violation of the Espionage Act. She suffered greatly for the decision to express dissent through information, not unlike like the earlier victims of the Espionage Act.</p>
<p>Even though she was a soldier, Manning’s will for peace overrode her loyalty to a system she was discovering to be broken. Her First Amendment Rights didn’t apply as a whistleblower, and she signed a plea agreement. In the 1919 trial against Charles Schenck, Judge Holmes believed that expressions that posed a “clear and present danger” and had a good chance of success should be punished, but drew the line at punishing ideas. However, the effect of his rulings helped set a standard that allows the possibility of punishing a person for sharing or acting upon an ideal.</p>

<p class="caption">A satirical cartoon featuring Jesus as a prisoner.</p>
</div>
<p>In a depiction by George Bellows of Jesus, the quintessential idealist, in prison, it is written that “Thou shalt not kill” and “Blessed are the peacemakers”. Noble are the peacemakers, sure, but are they actually blessed by those in the position to do so? President Obama hasn't protected Manning, but he has blessed her out:</p>
<blockquote>
“If I was to release stuff, information that I’m not authorized to release, I’m breaking the law. (...) We’re a nation of laws. We don’t individually make our own decisions about how the laws operate. (…) He broke the law.”</blockquote>
<p>Any action that breaks the law is considered a crime. Considering what is and isn’t offensive is a nuanced ethical process. It’s difficult to reach a consensus on what constitutes crime, but it’s notable that the majority opinion of the community is a factor in determining standards of criminal behavior. It’s time to assert our  will through discussions of the cases being tried under violations of the U.S. Espionage Act for the sake of future change. I think that through the might of increased public awareness, we can help Congress make moves towards reforming the Espionage Act to better serve the people, rather than three letter agencies. It is currently possible for the Supreme Court Justices to revisit the constitutionality of the Espionage Act, in the case of an appeal. With the threat of heavy sentences often being held over defendants, plea deals that include forfeiting most rights to appeal are normal and thus this situation rarely occurs.</p>
<p>Being American means opportunity and reward for so many. Political prisoners often receive no compensation or reward other than that of public support (in some cases). Often, they are brave people with something to lose by taking a stand. Shouldn’t the Supreme Court Justices bless the peacemakers by extending whistleblower protection to include ethical defense rights in Espionage Act cases? I say they should, lest the peacemakers continue to be damned.</p>
